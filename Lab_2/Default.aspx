          <p>Welcome to Inland Marina located on the south shore of Inland Lake, just a small commute from major centers in the south west. 
              Inland Marina was established in 1967 shortly after Inland Lake was created as a result of the South West dam.<br/> 
              From its humble beginnings, it has grown to be the largest marina in Inland Lake. Due to the warm climate that extends year-round, 
              Inland Lake has become a popular tourist destination in the south west. Boat owners from California, Arizona, Nevada and Utah 
              are attracted to the area.&nbsp;<br />
              Inland Marina has 90 slips ranging in size from 16 to 32 feet in length.&nbsp; 
              Dock services include electrical and fresh water.
